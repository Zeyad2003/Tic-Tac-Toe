<hr>

- I used ```JavaFX``` to create the game and the GUI.


- You can find a multiple comments in the code to help you understand how functions work together.


- The game is over when all fields are taken, or one player has three in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally).


- I used ```MiniMax``` Algorithm to make the computer play and get the best move every time.


- The Algorithm work by searching the tree of all possible moves and choosing the move that leads to the best score.


- The score is calculated by the ```MiniMax``` function which returns the best score for the current player.


- If the computer plays then we try to maximize the score, and minimize it otherwise.


- I used **Recursion** and **Backtracking** to get the best move and undo the move after calculating it, then choose the best cell to play.


- To run the game you should add the ```JavaFX``` library to the project and run the ```Main``` class.
